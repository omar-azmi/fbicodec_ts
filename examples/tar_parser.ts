	 *  - `User = 7 = 4 + 2 + 1 == [true, true, true]`, which means: read, write, and exec permissions granted
	 *  - `Group = 5 = 4 + 0 + 1 == [true, false, true]`, which means: read, and exec permissions granted

	 *    - if the referenced regular file were renamed or deleted, the hard link will still be referencing the original content correctly.
	 *    - in other words, if a tar archive software were deleting a "regular" file header of the name `"hello/world1.txt"`, which is also referenced by multiple "hardlink" file headers of the names `"Y/worldX.txt"` (where Y and X are variables), the software is responsible for:
	 *      - selecting one of the hardlinks, say `"A/worldB.txt"`
	 *      - replacing the "regular" file header with a clone of the `"A/worldB.txt"` hardlink header
	 *      - renaming the cloned `"A/worldB.txt"` hardlink header's `typeflag` from `"1"` (hardlink) to `"0"` (regular)
	 *      - renaming all other hardlinks `"Y/worldX.txt"`'s `linkname` from `"hello/world1.txt"` to the new name `A/worldB.txt`
	 *      - think of it as though YOU are managing a filesystem and its referencing system
	 *    - a hardlink file's `size` should be the same as its referenced file's `size` field, even though there shouldn't be data-content blocks following the hardlink header block, but rather, it should jump to the original referenced header's data-content blocks
	 *    - a hardlink can reference either a "regular" file or another "hardlink", but traversing up the dependency tree, there should always be ONE "regular" file at the root
	 *  - `"symlink"`: encoded as `"2"`, for a symbolic-link that references another file (of any `typeflag`). these are not immune to reference breaking/changing if the headers they reference change their `name` or get deleted
	 *    - a symlink's `size` field must be zero (`"0"`), because it doesn't occupy physical space, and is just a reference to another header's file `name`
